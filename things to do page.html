                    <p class="main-text">As at all UK National Museums, entry is free, though certain extra attractions are charged for.</p>

                    <p class="main-text">The Armouries was voted number 1 out of 146 other attractions in Leeds, on Trip Advisor, with 4.5/5 as voted by over 2,900 people. Here are some of the comments visitors made:</p>

                    <p class="main-text">"Fantastic afternoon at the Royal Armouries, very interesting and great displays with right mix of wording, exhibits and live examples.Attended one of the free talks on 1st world war and the young guy giving it was fantastic, he was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and spoke well even with a cough. Great ambassador for the Armouries.Would definitely recommend." (Joe from London)</p>

                    <p class="main-text">"Exhibitions are very interesting, a good look at history and weapons through the ages. Not glorifying war though, so has a wide appeal to young and old. Although the armouries has free entrance there is a car parking fee but worth paying. There is also a small fee to watch the outdoor entertainment for which tickets are sold in the museum. The jousting and horse riding stunts are very good and so is the birds of prey display." (Sjmc50 from Leeds)</p>

                    <p class="main-text">"For geeks of history like me, somewhere interesting to stroll or family trip this place is one of the best in the North. Genuinely a must see if you think it might be your thing and easily entertaining enough if you're not so sure." (Howard61 from Harrogate, Yorkshire)</p>

                        Roundhay Park is one of the biggest city parks in Europe. It is one of the most popular parks in Leeds due to its size, grandeur and array of things to see and do. Three miles north of Leeds city centre, the Park covers over 700 acres of rolling parkland, lakes, woodlands, formal gardens and contains several cafes, two playgrounds, the popular visitor attraction Tropical World and much more.</p>

                    <p class="main-text"> Canal Gardens <br>
                        There are three main parts to Canal Gardens, a grassed area of mature trees (which are decorated with lights around Christmas), flower gardens along a rectangular lake 350 feet (107 m) by 34 feet (10 m) which resembles part of a canal, dating from 1833, and a walled garden built c. 1816 as a vegetable garden for the Mansion House which contains a collection of roses, and provides the entrance to Tropical World. The Canal Gardens are to the west of the main area of the park, separated from it by Prince's Avenue.</p>


                    <p class="main-text"> Monet Garden<br>This is a path leading to the Alhambra garden, planted 1999 based on Claude Monet's garden at Giverny (1902). It leads north from Mansion Lane, to the north of the main area of the park.</p>


                    <p class="main-text"> Alhambra Garden<br> This is an area with a central rectangular pond with fountains, inspired by a similar water feature at the Generalife in the Alhambra in Spain. It is to the north of Mansion Lane, north of the main area of the park.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="main-text">Other Gardens <br> The Friends Garden (meaning the Friends of Roundhay Park) is a secluded one off the rose garden of Canal Gardens. There are also gardens for blind people with scented plants and braille inscriptions.</p>

                <div class="col-md-8">

                    <p class="roundhay-subheadings">Tropical World</p>

                    <p class="main-text">Within Canal Gardens, and separated by Street Lane from the main area of the park, is a group of glasshouses with areas representing different climates from around the world, which holds the largest collection of tropical plants in the UK outside Kew Gardens.</p> 

                    <p class="main-text">Tropical World has a butterfly house and aquariums. There are many birds and some reptiles living free inside, and many other animals in enclosures including a popular group of meerkats. A nocturnal house has creatures such as bats which are active at night. In 2015 following further refurbishments a new Aztec zone opened that included the aquarium area being transformed into a new Amazon themed zone where you can see new residents including piranhas and salamanders.</p>
